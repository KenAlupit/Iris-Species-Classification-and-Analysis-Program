# Iris-Species-Classification-and-Analysis-Program
This program uses logistic regression to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, model training, visualization of pair plots, and evaluation using a confusion matrix. Users can input sepal and petal dimensions to predict Iris species and view prediction probabilities.
